Report is contained as a .pdf in the root folder.

Data is contained in the ./data folder, as a number of sheets containing hand-collected Amazon review data and one analysis sheet generated from Dedoose. Each sheet of reviews contains ~50 entries and are organized by product (Amazon Alexa or Echo), then further subdivided by time period (2015-2016 or 2022-2023), then finally rating (low/1.0-3.0 or high/4.0-5.0). "Analysis results.xlsx" contains a chart containing the frequency of each tag (defined within the report) within each data set and some breakdown per sheet.
